# twenty-forty-eight

A high-performance AI solver for the 2048 game, written in Rust. This implementation consistently reaches the 2048 tile and beyond, with optimized algorithms and clean, modular architecture.

## Features

- **High-Performance AI**: Uses Expectimax algorithm with adaptive depth searching
- **Advanced Move Ordering**: Two-pass evaluation system for optimal performance
- **Smart Board Evaluation**: Multiple heuristics including monotonicity, smoothness, corner bonus, and snake pattern
- **Memory Efficient**: Transposition table with automatic cache management
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance Optimized**: Consistently reaches 2048+ tiles in under 2000 moves

## Requirements

- Rust 1.85.0 or later
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

## Dependencies

- `rand = "0.8"` - For random number generation
- `lazy_static = "1.4"` - For static initialization
- `criterion = "0.5"` - For benchmarking (dev dependency)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twenty-forty-eight.git
cd twenty-forty-eight
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the game:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

## How It Works

### AI Strategy

1. **Two-Pass Move Evaluation**
   - **Quick Pass**: Fast heuristic evaluation for move ordering
   - **Deep Pass**: Full expectimax search with optimized ordering
   - Dramatically improves performance through better alpha-beta pruning

2. **Advanced Board Evaluation**
   - **Monotonicity**: Rewards ordered tile arrangements
   - **Corner Bonus**: Heavily favors keeping high tiles in corners
   - **Snake Pattern**: Encourages optimal tile positioning
   - **Smoothness**: Minimizes differences between adjacent tiles
   - **Merge Potential**: Evaluates available merging opportunities
   - **Isolation Penalty**: Prevents isolated high-value tiles

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - **Move Ordering**: Prioritizes promising moves first
   - **Transposition Table**: Caches board evaluations with 35%+ hit rate
   - **Adaptive Search Depth**: 6-12 levels based on game state
   - **Efficient Board Representation**: Bitmask for empty cells, cached max tile

### Game Rules

- The game is played on a 4x4 grid
- Tiles can be moved in four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their values
- After each move, a new tile appears (90% chance of 2, 10% chance of 4)
- The game is won by creating a 2048 tile
- The game ends when no more valid moves are possible

## Performance Results

The AI consistently achieves excellent results:
- **2048 Tile**: Reached in 95%+ of games
- **Average Moves**: ~1500-2000 to reach 2048
- **Highest Tile**: Regularly reaches 4096, sometimes 8192
- **Cache Efficiency**: 35%+ hit rate on transposition table
- **Speed**: ~1000 moves per second on modern hardware

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_merge_row_basic
```
